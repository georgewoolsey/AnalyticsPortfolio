# Using R Markdown {#intro}

This chapter demonstrates some techniques for utilizing R Markdown to compile and share data analyses.
The *[R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)* (Xie, Allaire, & Grolemund 2018) was the primary reference for compiling this chapter and is an excellent resource for continued work in R Markdown.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# load packages
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(tidyverse)
library(dataRetrieval)
library(dygraphs)
library(xts)
# prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

### Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

### Data Download

```{r downloader, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}

## pull stream flow data using dataRetrieval package
q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')

```

### Static Data Plotter

```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}
## ggplot line chart
ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')
```

### Interactive Data Plotter

```{r}
## transform data to xts object
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)

## dygraph to make interactive line chart
dygraph(q_xts, main = "Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins, CO") %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)")

```

## Assignment

1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize.

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 

### DyGraph example

#### Interact with this chart!

```{r}
## transform data to xts object
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)

## dygraph to make interactive line chart
dygraph(q_xts, main = "Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins, CO") %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2)

```

### Poudre River Overview

  The Cache la Poudre River in Larimer County, Colorado is *one of 55 designated [National Heritage Areas](https://www.nps.gov/places/cache-la-poudre-river-national-heritage-area.htm)* in the United States. The river showcases historical developments built by early Euro-American settlers, a popular trail system which follows the river through Fort Collins, and miles of natural beauty which, despite increasing human development, remains prime wildlife habitat. The **Bird Conservancy of the Rockies** has organized a community science project to study Eastern Screech-Owls along the Cache la Poudre River in Fort Collins and is currently [seeking volunteer surveyors](https://www.birdconservancy.org/get-involved/volunteer/citizen-science/) for the period March to mid-May. For those interested in the water flow dynamics of the river, there are several stream gauges maintained by **Colorado Division of Water Resources** with [open access to data](https://dwr.state.co.us/Tools/Stations?Stations=All&submitButton=Submit&SelectedGeoValue=waterDivisionDiv&SelectedWaterDivisionId=1&SelectedStationType=Stream%20Gage&SelectedAdditionalValue=waterSourceDiv&WaterSourceDropdownSearch.WaterSourceName=00205018&WaterSourceDropdownSearch.DbSetNum=37).
